# STM32 Driver Setup #

STM32 devices are supported under the <b>CubeMX</b> framework. This entire sub-folder `Trifecta-STM32` should be copied into the `Drivers` folder of your STM32 CubeMX project. 

Typical folder structure: 

```
YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/
  ├── Drivers/
  │   └── Trifecta-STM32/
  └── Inc/
  │   └── etc... etc...
  └── Src/
      └── etc... etc...
```

Work in progress!
